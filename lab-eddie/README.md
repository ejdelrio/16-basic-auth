Welcome, welcome. 

This is my lab for day 16 of CF 401...
Yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.

So this is short and simple. To the point.

Gotta get that server running. We can do that by typing npm run start in the lab-eddie dir.
Make sure the dependancies are installed first!!! npm i that s***.

Next, we open a browser or a terminal window and do some httpie magic. OR whatever medium you prefer

we do an 
http POST :3000/api/newuser userName=='Ted Bundy' email=='tedbundy@crazy.com' password=='ted4life'

This will give us back an authentication token :D and a 200 code. It means it worked. Hooray!!!!
